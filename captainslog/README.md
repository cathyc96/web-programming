README for Lab 6: Captain's Log

1) This lab has been correctly implemented. At first I thought I had to make it
so that all the messages loaded as soon as you refreshed the page but Ming said
the way I did it (where all the old messages show up when you enter a new message)
is fine.

2) I received help in office hours with Ming for this lab.

3) I spent approximately 5 hours on this lab.
