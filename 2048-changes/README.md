1) I believe all aspects of this assignment have been correctly.

2) I received help from Ming in office hours, TA David Bernstein, TA Derek Benson,
   and I discussed the process of sending data from the client with Josie Barth.
   I also heavily utilized stack overflow posts. I also heavily utilized Ming's
   nodemongoapp example and took code directly from it.

3) I spend about 20 hours working on this assignment.
