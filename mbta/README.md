1) I think that most of the aspects of this project have been implemented
 correctly.
2) I received help in office hours with TA David Bernstein and with Ming. I also
 used a modified version of the haversineDistance function found on
 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript
 to implement the Haversine formula.
3) I spend approximately 15 hours working on this assignment.
