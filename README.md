COMP 20 Fall 2016 Private Repo for Catherine Cowell

This is a repository for my work for Tufts University Web Programming.

My favorite assignment in this course was the MBTA project, which shows an interactive map of the MBTA red line train stations and a real time scheduale of upcoming trains. I enjoyed this assignment because of the relevancy and usefulness of the web applicaiton. I also enjoyed learning more about working with APIs (this assignment uses the Google Maps API and the MBTA API).

This course has allowed me to grow a lot since day one. I have learned so much about web development on the client and server side, a little bit about web security, and a lot about working in a team on a long term project.

I think the most important thing I learned in this course has been the importance of communication in team work. For example, delaing with merge conflicts on github was a big problem in my group and helped us learn the importance of discussing our changes with each other even as we were working on separate parts of the project. Another time we learned this was when we were struggling with making our database queries, and even those group members not working on the server side had to learn about it and help.

Now that I have finished this course, I think I would like to delve deeper into the field of web design and learn more about using front end frameworks and designing user interfaces.
